</p>

A Mathematica package that provides a set of functions for performing coordinate-based tensor calculations with a focus on general relativity and black holes in particular.

## Example usage

All calculations using GeneralRelativityTensors require a metric with explicit values. You can define your own metric and there are also a range of useful build in metrics, i.e.,

```
g = ToMetric["Kerr"]
```
Other build in metrics include
